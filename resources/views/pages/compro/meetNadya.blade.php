                <?php /*<p>I graduated from Brawijaya University, majoring in Accounting with a specialization in taxation. I am assigned a number of tax compliance clients of which I do monthly tax computations/review, payment and reporting. Also, I am also involved in preparation of documents related to tax audits and appeals for major national and international clients. </p>
                <p>I am eager to develop my knowledge and skills in taxation. I experience that the leadership team in RB is very committed in developing their people. Every day is always an exciting day for me to gain new experiences. </p>
                <p>I was selected to join a team that handled the incorporation of a permanent establishment, monthly and annual tax compliance, up to their dissolution. This client is a global event organizer that handled the opening ceremony of Asian Games 2018. I was beyond excited to get a special access during the rehearsal and the Game, and got a chance to work with their team in serving Indonesiaâ€™s remarkable event. </p>*/ ?>
